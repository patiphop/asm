## Aof Saving Money to Plan Retirements

The **Aof Saving Money Calculator** is designed to help users plan for their future by calculating how much they will save for retirement based on their current savings strategy. This tool allows individuals to input their monthly savings, yearly interest rate, and other parameters to project their total savings over time. 

The calculator is particularly useful for long-term financial planning, providing insights into how small monthly contributions, compounded annually, can accumulate to a substantial amount by the time the user reaches retirement age.

By default, the calculator is set with the following values in the **Aof (Default)** mode:
- **Monthly Savings**: à¸¿10,000
- **Yearly Interest**: 7%
- **Current Age**: 30
- **Retirement Age**: 60

These default values reflect a practical, moderate approach to saving for retirement, assuming a relatively steady income and investment growth over time. For those who want to personalize their plan, the **Custom** mode offers flexibility by allowing adjustments to the monthly savings amount, interest rate, and other variables, giving a more tailored projection of retirement savings.
